                  <p>What if instead of having to know the intricacies of every server and software in your stack, you
                    could simply pick a type of software, and let your tools do the rest? </p>
                  <p>This was a question proposed recently by Thirdwave Insights and their topology deployment tool. I
                    have spent a few days getting to know the technology, and wanted to provide a little feedback. </p>

                <h3><strong>First, What is Automate.Insights? </strong></h3>
                <p>Automate.Insights is a visualization and formatting tool for the creation of application stacks.
                  Working in tandem with Chef and Automate.Insights custom plugin (Knife-Topo), it is designed to create
                  software stacks on multiple nodes at once rather than one at a time. Secondly, with it's human
                  friendly ui interface, it allow a casual Chef user to customize servers to their use case and task.
                  This allows us to think and manage an application from a global perspective, rather than a single node
                  at a time. This is in many ways more natural to our way of thinking than a list of cookbooks. </p>
                <h3><strong>Clarification of Terms</strong></h3>
                <p>After testing the Automate.Inisghts tool it was apparent that it was a well thought out system.
                  However I did want to clarify some terms to avoid initial confusion. Basic understanding of Chef is
                  recommended as well. </p>
                <p><strong>Business System</strong>: <span
                    style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:12.8000001907349px">A large
                    enterprise typically has multiple applications supporting the work of different business
                    units:</span></p>
                <ul>
                  <li>customer data analytics</li>
                  <li>internal employee systems</li>
                  <li>R&amp;D application</li>
                  <li>company site/marketing</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each application contains unique, often proprietary software that needs to be managed. Understanding
                  each of these as a whole <strong>business system</strong> <span
                    style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:12.8000001907349px">the best
                    way to ensure the business unit's operational requirements are met</span>. <span
                    style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:12.8000001907349px">On a Chef
                    server, separation between business systems might be achieved using <strong>organizations</strong>;
                    or one organization might manage multiple business systems, using tags to distinguish them.</span>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Topology</strong>: The topology of nodes and their configuration <span
                    style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:12.8000001907349px">information
                    for a deployment of the business system</span>. Using knife-topo, you can map out the topology of a
                  cluster of nodes and ensure that they are properly configured.</p>
                <p>Let's take an example from one of our business systems, the company website. </p>
                <p>A typical company site could consist of</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>a webserver</li>
                  <li>a dbserver</li>
                  <li>a load balancer</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These are all separate and can be managed as individual cookbooks, but together they are one
                  functioning "topology" of nodes. By this definition, it is a topology. </p>
                <p><strong>Blueprint</strong>: This is like a topology, and also not which can be slightly confusing.
                  <span
                    style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:12.8000001907349px">Essentially,
                    a blueprint is an outline or template for a topology that can have various tweaks done to it for
                    adjusting to certain use cases. </span></p>
                <p>For example, in our company site information, traditional setup for this is to have a dev, stage, and
                  prod server setup for the site. The original topology calls for</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>an app server</li>
                  <li>a database server</li>
                  <li>a load balancer. </li>
                </ul>
                <p>However, in the dev and staging server, it isn't necessary to have a load balancer. You dont HAVE to
                  route traffic, so why incur the cost of running one needlessly 24/7? That's where the blueprint comes
                  into play. It allows you to make adjustments to the overall topology, override attributes, then push
                  that blueprint to the Chef server for provisioning. In doing so, the staging and dev blueprints will
                  look more like</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>an appserver</li>
                  <li>a database server</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This is somewhat simplified, but honestly not by much. It becomes more simple to think of things from
                  a holistic perspective. More importantly, with knife-topo, you can provision all the machines at once.
                  It truly becomes a one click proccess. </p>
                <h3><strong>Things I really liked</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Leverage existing Infrastructure: </strong>Those of you who have put in your time with
                    cookbook development know the learning curve involved with Chef. Being able to leverage existing
                    cookbooks rather than abandon it for yet another config management tool is a welcome alternative. It
                    means less time porting infrastructure, and more time working with what already works well.  </li>
                  <li><strong>True one click deployment: </strong>Running through the basic training module and the
                    topology.json file, I was able to provision a three node cluster with a one line command. Not one
                    line that wraps over 4 in your terminal, but one line. This simplification is a great improvement
                    over the status quo. </li>
                  <li><strong>Allows for holistic viewpoint: </strong>Automate.Insights encourages you to think about
                    what should be consistent across a system, and gives you views so it's easier to line up how your
                    software stacks are configured.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3><strong>Possible Concerns</strong></h3>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>You need to know Chef to use it: </strong>I am a more advanced Chef user, so after a
                    couple hours I was more than fine with the product and the benefits it was offering.
                    <p> If you are unfamiliar with Chef however you would be better served starting <a
                        href="http://learn.chef.io/">here</a> getting an understanding  of the basics of Chef before
                      coming back to this blog. The Automate.Insights tool was designed to simplify your existing
                      cookbook infrastructure, so if your organization has existing cookbooks you may be fine. <br />
                       </p>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>Chef-provisioning also sets up topologies: </strong>In the last year much buzz has been
                    made about the use of provisioning, which uses cookbook resources to build machines. There is some
                    overlap between this and what knife-topo and Automate.Insights does. In fact, speaking with the A.I
                    team, it is their intention to integrate with Chef Provisioning. For those of us who have been
                    waiting for provisioning to mature, Automate.Insights might be a better option to get started with
                    deploying and configuring topologies. <br />
                     </li>
                  <li><strong>Is it really better than the status quo?: </strong>This is the key question. Rather than
                    try to explain, I decided to show it with a more practical application.
