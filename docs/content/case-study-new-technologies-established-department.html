                <h3>When To Adopt?</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>When new technologies emerge, what is appropriate to bring into an existing department? </li>
                  <li>Are these technologies leading edge or bleeding edge?</li>
                  <li>Are the tools mature?</li>
                  <li>Can the existing team members learn the new practices required ?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A fortune 500 company had to make some decisions like this for one of it's most important development
                  teams. The product line it has invested in was provided by a large, well known provider, but it was
                  relatively untested. <strong><em>Should we use it ? Where ? Under what conventions</em></strong> ?</p>
                <h3>The Technology Stack</h3>
                <p>I was called in help with this process after doing a couple other mission critical projects
                  successfully in a related departement. We took the full complement of<strong> BPEL, Rules, and SOA
                    processes provided by this vendor</strong> and put them through their paces enhancing an existing
                  functionality set with known issues that had to be fixed.</p>
                <p>The fallout was interesting. In some cases we abandoned the new technologies after a couple of
                  months, as we discoverd them too brittle in tooling, and inadequately supported for everyday
                  deployments. Other parts of the suite worked fabulously well, and we included them immediately,
                  <strong>and got the resulting immediate boost in productivity</strong>.</p>
                <h3>Advising Management</h3>
                <p>By providing seasoned and benchmarked experience, and being able to <strong>execute the same task in
                    multiple technologies</strong>, I was able to help <strong>management make sound decisions</strong>
                  on which pieces to keep, which to forestall, and even a few other technologies to bring in as
                  alternates which they hadn't even thought of.</p>
                <p>By keeping their experimenation narrowly focused and in experienced hands, and splitting it between
                  in-house talent with experience in their business, and external experience to bring in outside
                  standards, we were able to focus expenses on where they could do the most good - and<strong> help the
                    company move into the future without cutting itself on the bleeding edge</strong>.</p>
