# 20 years of bringing apps into the world

My name is Pete Carapetyan.

dataFundamentals has been my brand name for contracting to the corporate world since Jan 1, 2000

A lot has change in the 20 years since first published a site to this domain. This is probably the 4th major platform swap? I didn't even keep track.

One thing hasn't changed. I'm still bringing apps into the world, and those apps are still employing the latest technology standards.

This site is written in [rocket](https://rocket.modern-web.dev/) with a theme by yours truly.
