Most of what I do is free, open source or community based.

- [webAppWriter.com](https://webappwriter.com) where I write, and where I document my Rocket themes offering
- [ Fins Rocket Themes on github](https://github.com/petecarapetyan/fins-rocket-themes) One of my favorite open-source projects, to date.
- [Lit & Friends - Slack feed](https://lit.dev/slack-invite) Where hundreds of browser standards HTML/CSS/JS coders share approaches to standards based development. Lit is a google product.
