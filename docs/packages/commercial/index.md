# Commercial Help

## Non-commercial help?

Just a reminder - most of what I do is free, open source or community based.

- [webAppWriter.com](https://webappwriter.com) where I write, and where I document my Rocket themes offering
- [ Fins Rocket Themes on github](https://github.com/petecarapetyan/fins-rocket-themes) Encapsulates the best of my work to date.
- [Lit & Friends - Slack feed](https://lit.dev/slack-invite) Where hundreds of us share approaches to standards based development.

## Consulting

If you need commercial help, I'd be happy to start with a paid appointment.
