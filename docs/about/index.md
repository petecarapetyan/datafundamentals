# 2021 - a year for site migrations

This year will see app-building skills turn towards [**site migrations**](/about/current/#site-migrations).

This might seem retro, but it's not. _**The best apps have made the normal WordPress or Drupal site look sluggish and difficult to maintain, by comparison.**_ Whodathunkit?

Keep coming back, or even check in with me personally, if you want to [**follow the progress**](/about/current/) so you can update your own site, using what I learn and develop.
