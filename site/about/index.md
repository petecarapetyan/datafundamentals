# About

dataFundamentals was established as a trade name for the work of Pete Carapetyan and other associates since 2000.

It is a corporate focused market.

Our traditional market is replacing legacy stacks within corporate departments, by executing tasks in newer and simpler stacks - as these stacks mature.

_**Simplicity really is inevitable**_, it's not just our slogan. But what if legacy-complexity is all your team knows?

Web based HTML/CSS/JS is where the market is headed. Fast, simple, cheap - AND already becoming a standard within the major browsers. Incumbents such as React and phone apps will fight this trend - but they may find themselves [too clever by half](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/too_clever_by_half).

App or web site? It is all merging, the distinction is becoming meaningless.

We follow simpler, standards based coding, through this market.

- Our customers go farther with their budgets.
- Allows corporations to retain their code investments over a longer period of time.
- It flows with, rather than against, the direction of the market.
