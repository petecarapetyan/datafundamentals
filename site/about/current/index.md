The [closest thing to a corporate blog](https://webappwriter.com/blog/) bloviates extensively on market trends. Perhaps the best summary is that corporations are becoming aware of how much simpler things are now, since 2005 and even 2015.

## Resources

We've plowed a bunch of resources into Rocket SSG this year, or more specifically - [theming for same](https://webappwriter.com/fins/). 

This is all work that only a mathematician specializing in set theory and armed with our assumptions should ever care about. Since that doesn't describe anyone, we expect that this work may go un-noticed, except to our customers who _**just want to succeed, dammit.**_

## Testable Hypothesis

["No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy"](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Helmuth_von_Moltke_the_Elder) so you see [all current experiments](https://github.com/petecarapetyan/fins-rocket-themes#readme) out in the open.

By making each one of the 17 web presences slightly different, we have - and shall continue to learn many things, just by iterating.

The public nature of the testing has helped, as well.

## Google as Lead?

Markets trend by feelings, but then coalesce around simple value math - _eventually_. So feelings can be hazardous for techies making decisions on what stacks to invest in. Today it's WordPress and React. Tommorrow?

Google has been strangely patient in sticking with simple math in it's Chrome investments, and _**had gone almost entirely standards based**_, putting it almost a decade behind Facebook's React in market adoption.

For the past few years our efforts have almost entirely focused on the Google Chrome and Google Firebase team's offerings. Yet this is without loyalty. For us, it's just simple math - these two teams have come closest by a mile, to meeting our values.

By values, this standards based Google approach looks more like React than React does, more like WordPress than WordPress does, and more like AWS than AWS does. Feels odd - wherever we go, there is Google. Yet we claim no loyalty.
