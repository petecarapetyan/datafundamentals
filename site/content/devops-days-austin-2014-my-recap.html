<em><span style="font-size:9px">This blog is one of a series of blogs on the challenges of learning Chef, ops, and the technical world of IT all in one motion. Jeff Carapetyan is an Ops consultant concentrating on basic Chef work, and is sometimes available for contracts in the Austin area.</span></em></pre>
                <p><span style="font-size:14px">That was a whirlwind of a couple of days for me. I am really glad that
                    everything went well and smoothly in <a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2014-austin/">DevOps Days
                      Austin</a>. There seems to be a good base for future expansion and growth. Thanks to all the
                    volunteer organizers that made it an enjoyable experience!</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-size:14px">In regards to takeaways there are probably more than fit into one blog
                    post. For easy reading, I will divide it into categories of what I learned from talks, and what I
                    learned overall. </span></p>
                <p><strong><span style="font-size:16px">What I learned from specific talks</span></strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span style="font-size:14px"> <u>AWS is the player</u>: Most of the talks that involved a cloud
                      service provider mentioned working with AWS, not even Rackspace, our own local hero. There is
                      nothing wrong with the other cloud providers, but it seems that by default everybody is using
                      AWS. </span></li>
                  <li><span style="font-size:14px"><u>Accents are badass</u>: Listened to the guys at Sumologic. Not
                      only did they have a good presentation, the foreign accents really topped it off.</span></li>
                  <li><span style="font-size:14px"><u>Matt Ray knows his stuff</u>: Not only is he very adept at
                      business acumen and selling the product, he is very in depth from a technical standpoint. He is a
                      good resource. </span></li>
                  <li><span style="font-size:14px"><u>When I grow up, I want to be Alex Corley</u>: Watching his
                      presentation, it was clear how much he knew and how badass he was. there is a lot of knowledge to
                      be mined from that.</span></li>
                  <li><span style="font-size:14px"><u>More lightning talks:</u> the lightning talks were a very good
                      format. It was quick, and kept up with my attention span. More conferences should have a lightning
                      talk session.</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong><span style="font-size:16px">What I learned Overall</span></strong></p>
                <ul>
                  <li><span style="font-size:14px"><u>There are a lot of people interested in DevOps</u>: When you take
                      up an entire theater with people standing in the back, it is obvious that there is an interest in
                      the technology community to make DevOps a happening thing.</span></li>
                  <li><span style="font-size:14px"><u>There are clearly some success cases:</u> I was happy to hear
                      about the usual suspects in Netflix, facebook, etsy, and other big companies that are pushing some
                      <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phoenix_Project:_A_Novel_About_IT,_DevOps,_and_Helping_Your_Business_Win">Pheonix
                        Project</a> concepts along. </span></li>
                  <li><span style="font-size:14px"><u>The small success stories are missing:</u> In an open talk
                      discussion on the first day, a group of 20 guys talked for a good while on how they think DevOps
                      should be approached for organizations. Then, all of a sudden one person just asks the simple
                      question, "Does anybody have a success story here where they took a DevOps initiative and had a
                      measurable success for their company?". Immediately the group of 20+ people went silent. To me,
                      this is frightening. Either we are not being successful, or not doing a good enough job of
                      observing our success stories.</span></li>
                  <li><span style="font-size:14px"><u>Nobody knows how to make this a Dev thing too:</u> Almost every
                      person that was at DevOps days thought about this from an operations perspective. While there are
                      many developers interested in the DevOps movement, It would seem that almost none of them came to
                      the event. We need to make sure that this is an all-inclusive thing (security guys too,
                      maybe?). </span></li>
                </ul>
                <p><span style="font-size:14px">If anybody had any other thoughts or wanted to discuss this, then feel
                    free to contact me. </span></p>
