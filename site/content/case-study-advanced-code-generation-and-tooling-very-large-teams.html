                  <h6>by Pete Carapetyan</h6>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>By 2003, dataFundamentals was becoming fairly well-known for its use of code generation and
                    frameworks within the Dallas area java user community.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p><strong><span style="font-size:medium">Large team, significant multiplier</span></strong></p>
                  <p>With a challenging implementation to complete, and the efforts of a very large team to gain from any
                    potential multiplier effect, I was engaged to automate as many of the development team's efforts as it
                    could.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p><strong><span style="font-size:medium">Analysis Required!</span></strong></p>
                  <p>Ready to generate the required code on his first day on the team, I came up on a new problem that
                    wasn't anticipated. No one seemed to know exactly what it was that created each new component! The app
                    was a J2EE app, but the implementation a highly idiosycratic and proprietary implementation using many
                    non-standard approaches. It took a month of digging and research to come up with the code templates
                    and source files for generating against!</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p><span style="font-size:medium"><strong>Success beyond expectations - Can you do it
                        again?</strong></span></p>
                  <p>If it took 2 weeks longer than expected to come up with the structure to start, the implementation of
                    the generator went much faster than team leaders expected, and working app was deployed in days, for
                    initial inspection.</p>
                  <p>As with any reasonable code generation effort, it only started with an 75% complete code base, and
                    hand work was expected for the remainder. Further work, with the developers doing the hand work,
                    clarified further automation that was possible, so additional generating routines were written to
                    automate each additional element as it was discovered, getting it to an easy 85% generated/manual
                    ratio.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p><strong><span style="font-size:medium">Easy to use Tools</span></strong></p>
                  <p>As soon as the generation routines were at a level where they could be run from the command line when
                    required from the latest source data, the advantages of a graphical tool became apparent for a larger
                    team. I was able to spend a few days and convert the existing command lines tools to Eclipse tools
                    that would run in the developers' existing IDE.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p><strong><span style="font-size:medium">Expanded to Testing Tools</span></strong></p>
                  <p>Ahead of schedule and brimming with the enthusiasm that sometimes results from things working out
                    well, management pointed me to the web application testing problem.</p>
                  <p> </p>
                  <p>Another team member found an Eclipse tool that would work perfectly but it had some missing pieces.
                    As such it had the right kind of license, I was able to make some quick modifications in the tool that
                    expanded it's functionality in several key areas, closing the loop on some critical automated testing
                    that was not thought practical weeks before.</p>
