dataFundamentals was established as a trade name, or branding, for the work of Pete Carapetyan and other associates since 2000.

With the advent of AI, and disappearance of coding as a human task, dataFundamentals is re-imagining itself as a brand.

It is expected to go through many iterations through 2026 and beyond.
