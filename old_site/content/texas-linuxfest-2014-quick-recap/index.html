                  This weekend, Austin was host to the <strong>Texas Linux Fest</strong>. Though it did not receive the
                  same attendance as ROT Rally, it still had a couple hundred people walk through the convention center
                  to hear about all new things Linux. Here are a few of my takeaways from the convention&nbsp;</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Soooo much to learn:</strong> While most of the first day seemed to be a rehash of things
                    that I already learned, the second day was the complete opposite of that. In every talk that people
                    had, there was a new piece of technology or general practice that was essential to getting the
                    presentation, and I simply had not used it. It is a positive that I understood a lot of the basics,
                    but sometimes it can be frustrating that I have so much to learn. At least it's easier to learn now.
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>I am underutilizing Grep and append:</strong> There was a short session on the benefits of
                    pipe, grep, and append over the weekend. While I had used all of them, it is not a daily thing for
                    me. It was interesting and encouraging to see it used in action so well. I will have to start
                    practicing with that more.</li>
                  <li><strong>DevOps was not as well-represented as one would expect:</strong> Don't get me wrong. There
                    were plenty of companies there that were DevOpsy at the conference, but I am speaking more about the
                    people there. I don't know if what that means, but it would appear that a lot of the Linux community
                    still has a long way to go before fully embracing the DevOps cultural movement. That being said,
                    Linux in itself was just a movement 20 years ago, and look what it has become since.&nbsp;</li>
                  <li><strong>Interviewing can be a good thing:</strong> one of the best presentations of the weekend
                    (and in recent memory), was the one by <em><strong>Cory Quinn</strong></em> on how to sell yourself
                    during an interview. As a former recruiter, it was all very solid advice. In terms of presentation
                    delivery, that was one of the best live I have ever seen. I will be providing a link as soon as I
                    can get one to the video.</li>
                  <li><strong>There were a lot more women there than the average conference:</strong>&nbsp;It may be more
                    about the events that I have been attending in the last year, but there was a much larger female
                    group represented at the convention than I am used to seeing. It would be a welcome sight to have
                    more included in future events, maybe to at accurate demographic levels. I will have to talk about
                    it.&nbsp;</li>
