                <h3>Design</h3>
                <p>In the year 2000, dataFundamentals was engaged by a small engineering company with some unnecessarily
                  high clerical costs. Timekeeping for the dozens of engineers it had on site around the country had
                  created a mini-bureaucracy within its home office, and the owners wanted a more efficient way to get
                  the job done.</p>
                <p>DataFundamentals was engaged to design and create a secured web application to centralize all of the
                  records in a database that they could query and report on from within the home office.</p>
                <h3>Framework utilized to prevent duplication of effort</h3>
                <p>Expresso, then at version 4.2 was used as the secure web application platform, as it was a strong and
                  well documented J2EE platform that was already in use in thousands of installations worldwide. As I
                  had been a core contributor to this and previous releases, it made for an easy choice.</p>
                <h3>Code Generator Utilized</h3>
                <p>WebAppWriter, also written and me in earlier years, provided a working application within a few days.
                  Because the company already had a database it had been using (albeit one written in Microsoft Access),
                  it was easy to take this database, make some quick adjustments and data normalizations, and then point
                  the code generator at it to create a new web application written in the Expresso framework.</p>
                <h3>App customized to business rules</h3>
                <p>Immediate deployments made it possible for management to come up with requirements that it hadn't
                  been able to predict in advance. They didn't want to have to train field engineers how to enter data
                  correctly, so several enhancements were made to automate data entry and restrict fields to acceptable
                  entries based on project status.</p>
                <h3>In house admin trained to maintain app</h3>
                <p>From my first day on site, in-house engineers were involved in the process and brought along with the
                  processes and logic. As the app was deployed, the engineer was trained in its build and deployment, so
                  that he could customize the program at will.</p>
