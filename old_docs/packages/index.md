## Corporate Proof of Concept Packages

We are delighted to offer the following packages to help you achieve your _**faster, simpler, cheaper, less clever**_ &nbsp; &nbsp; web presence.

## Proof of Concept: _Lorem ipsum content_

$150

For the budget minded, you and/or your staff take a one hour tour.

- Choose from one of 17 starter themes
- Create new site from nothing
- Commit to github - ours, or yours
- Deploy to the web with Netlify
- You make content changes
- Add dynamic functionality from Npm
- Run Lighthouse tests

All the content would be [Lorem Ipsum placeholder text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorem_ipsum), and the photos all random, excepting any content or photos you wish to bring with you.

It's a lot to pack in an hour, but with a little hurryup we'll get it all done and you'll have a recorded session to fall back on as a reference, later.

## Proof of Concept: _Wordpress Migration Package_

Price $1200 and up - max cap set before starting.

We'll start with an inventory and brief discussion of your goals

- How many pages of which type do you wish to migrate?
- For each
  - The new look?
  - The old look?
  - Some kind of hybrid?
- Which WordPress plugins are also consumed?

Once you establish the answers to the above questions, a PoC can investigate:

- Manual migration
  - Which pages take how many minutes each to migrate manually?
  - Which processes work best for that specific migration?
- Automated migration
  - What is an appropriate automation budget for each group of pages?
  - Which migration strategy for that many pages of that type of migration?
  - What manual processes will still have to be budgeted for?
- Should a migration be avoided due to tightly coupled WordPress plugins?

As an example of the above, [a previous datafundamentals.com site](/pre2015/) was migrated on this domain, and experimentation led me to chose the following steps

- Only 50 pages at 3-5 minutes a page, so easier to do manually
- These pages were almost unimportant in value - so I kept the old styling as much as possible, and chose minimal design embellishments.

A Migration PoC

- Can take place in as little as a day or two of billings
- Will yeild you some degree of a working site, to use for evaluating a go forward decision

## Proof of Concept: _Theming Adaptation_

Price $1200 and up - max cap set before starting.

Start making a starter theme your own!

This PoC explores work with your chosen web design or designer, to adapt an existing Rocket theme towards your own web presence.

The work of this PoC may not represent a total transformation to the perfect theme of your desires, but instead demonstrates progress toward that goal, giving you a baseline for calibrating your own further changes against your ultimate budgets.

Or, if your goals are modest, this PoC may get you almost all the way there.
